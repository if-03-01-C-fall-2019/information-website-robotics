            A robot has been created that uses bacteria-filled fuel cells. The robot is capable of producing electricity
            from dead flies to power its battery. It can also use rotten apples to create fuel.

            Robot comes from the Chzech word "robota" which means "forced work or labor".

            The first humanoid robot was debuted in 1939. Elektro, built by Westinghouse, was seven feet tall and
