          <p>
            Robotic vacuum cleaner, or a "robovac", is a vacuum cleaner that has a certain level of autonomy
            to clean while some have additional methods like spinning brushes, mopping or UV sterilization.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            Some of the earliest home vacuum cleaners needed two people to operate them - one to vacuum and
            the other to push or pull the heavy machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the vacuum cleaners even have sensors that tell when the surface has been sufficiently cleaned.

            Fun Fact:
            Rambo Amadeus, a Belgrade-based Montenegrin singer-songwriter, has a practice to sometimes make performances
            which include playing on household appliances among which are predominant vacuum cleaners.

            <h3>Some Facts</h3>
            <p>The first ever robotic vacuum cleaner appeared in 1996.</p>
            <p>
              The company Dyson built and demonstrated a robot vacuum in 2001, but because of its high price, it was never
              released to the market.
