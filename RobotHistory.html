      <p>
        The history of robots has its origins in the ancient world. Today, a humanoid can envisage
        human-sized robots with the capacity for near-human thoughts and movement. The first uses
        of modern robots were in factories as industrial robots. Digitally controlled industrial
        robots and robots using artificial intelligence have been built since the 2000s.

        Eric - this was the name of one of the world's first real robots. He was built in 1928. Made
        of Aluminium Eric measured about 6 feet tall and weighed about 100 pounds. But after wowing
        audiences in Britain, where he was created, and elsewhere in Europe and the United States he
        disappeared. But then a team from the Science Museum of London rebuilt him.

        In World War I remote control weapons were used, based on the work of Nikola Tesla, who had
        constructed an electrical boat that could be remotely controlled by radio.

        Takeo Kanade created the first "direct drive arm" in 1981. The first of its kind, the arm's
        motors were contained within the robot itself, eliminating long transmissions.

        In 1994 one of the most successful robot-assisted surgery appliances was cleared by the
        FDA. The Cyberknife had been invented by John R. Adler and the first system was installed
        at Stanford University in 1991. This radiosurgery system integrated image-guided surgery
        with robotic positioning. The Cyberknife is now deployed to treat patients with brain or
        spine tumors. A x-ray camera tracks displacement and compensates for motion caused by
        breathing.

        And from the 2000s a lot of really cool new robots were introduced. The newer robots all
        had a big focus on artificial intelligence.
        The propably most popular robot is the Roomba,a robotic vacuum cleaner.
        Self-driving cars slowly started appearing around 2005, but there was a lot of room for
        improvement. Propably the best self-driving car ever released is the Tesla.
        In 2005, Honda revealed a new version of its ASIMO robot. And it is still one of the
        most advanced robots.
