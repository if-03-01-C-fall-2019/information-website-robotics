            In Japan there is a robot called the "Robear", he is shaped as a giant, gentle bear
            with a cartoonish head. He can lift and move patients in and out of bed into a
            wheelchair, help patients to stand, and to turn them to prevent bed sores as many
            times as you want. The Robear is there to save human personal from having to carry
            out strenous tasks, such as lifting patients out of bed.

            One of the really well developed medical robots is the daVinci robot. He is so
            precise that he can stitch a grape together.
